In this deck i describe every slide of the [DeepWork-Marp Deck](DeepWork-Marp.md) as being part of a [Method of Loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) journey.

Please forgive any weird described scenes - they are all fictional.

## Quote Slide

Imagine a boiled brain in a Harry Potter vessel - which is on fire after the water vaporized.

It needs continuos refilling until it boiled to the degree you expected.
