# Become a better engineer through Deep Work and continuous learning.


I have chosen that title because I believe that both, continuous learning and one of its core methods, Deep Work, made me a better engineer. I used the beginning of the year to read a couple of books about deliberate practice and how to learn - finally, after finishing university -  and i want to share with you how it changed my daily life.

## "The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled."

* imagine your their mind to be an empty cup - fill in as much as possible as fast as possible - your cup will eventually overflow
* that's how a lot of people actually learn - that's how i learned at the university from time to time and it has not been sustainable.
* but as you all know - just remember your time in school - it needs time and repetition to learn and sustain the vocabulary
* and you can only learn as much as a cup of tea every day - feed your fire every day a little and it will surprise yourself with sustainable knowledge.

## Why is learning important?

* we are knowledge workers
	* the software world is a fast changing environment - our javascript developers can tell one or two things about it
	* we are moving into the area of business models and technologies that can distrupt domains - this happens in a fast pace
	* we are confronted with a whole bunch of challenges day to day
 * we form and train CTOs
 	* 	generalists need a broad understanding of different domains and technologies
 	*

## When should we learn?

* at  the last conference i attended - the software craftsmanship london - they discussed this topic without a conclusion on a panel
* the most pressing question was whether we should have time to learn at work and my personal opinion is that we should - and for apparent reasons it needs to happen on a regular basis and not only when we are on the beach - and i have a personal example i will come to later
* a part from having the opportunity at work - you should encourage yourself for lifelong learning - remember the last time you wondered how a specific framework functions - but you didn't follow that curiosity because of time constraints
* but this curiosity is what you lost at scale while growing up - kids are curious by default but need to learn stuff at school which might be useful but we are not curious about
* our skills are all too often shaped passively - your first job as a software engineer introduces you to Java - so now you are a Java developer - then someone comes into the team and applies agile methods - now you learned to be agile
* learning should not happen by accident but deliberate - deliberate learners are the most efficient ones

---

## Motivation

* An important part to be an efficient learner is to know why you learn
* There a different ways why we learn - some learn for specific goals - to finish a course or to get a salary raise / promotion
* Those are good reasons to learn - but everyone had this phase in his or her life where learning was easy - because you were curious at that time
* to utilise this notion of learning out of curiosity it is important to provide yourself that space to learn - Mashooq for example has an hour every morning for himself to do whatever he wants. Doing sport - doing something healthy - read a book or to deliberately learn
* I have this space in the evening - every evening i put aside one hour to do something productie - monday and friday it is usually sport but from tuesday to thursday i normally try to learn something
* i want to highlight that avoiding a goal - like a course certificate - helps greatly with learning because you can take your time to really dig deep into the topic.
* i experienced the downside of having a goal while doing the robotics udacity course over the last 3 months. Before attending this course i learned whatever i wanted , for example testing kubernetes with google cloud or learning type writing but without any time constraints and it helped me to sustain the experience. On the other hand it takes way more effort to deeply learn in a course with time constraints and specific milestones.

## Mindset

Besides the motivation it is important to find the appropriate mindset to build a learning habit. In the software craftsmanship community it is called the Beginners mind - be open and eager and remove preconceptions before starting to learn. Be open to repeat the basics from time to time but also to move to different challenges to not stuck in a local optima. Tame your obsession - do not only practice your favorite technique, like functional programming but be open to other concepts as well. Mastering OOP will help you to become better at FP and the other way around. Make sure that you understand that it will take time to learn - step by step - bit by bit. And after you mastered the basics try to be creative - let your natural curiosity guide you into the areas where you start to explose and challenge knowledge. That's how you create progress. But it is equally important to relax. There is a concept of a focused mode and a diffuse mode. While we normally try to solve problems in the focused mode our diffuse mode will solve the difficult ones subconsciously.

## Deep Work and Shallow Work

* After discussing why it is important to learn and what is needed to do so efficiently i want to introduce Deep Work to you. I think everyone here knows it by the term flow. For the most of us it is easy to be in the flow while doinig something pleasent or in the case of software engineers, when we code. Those are the moments where we can dive easily into that state.
* And this it what Deep work means. Being in the flow over tasks needing cognitive effort to complete. It is important to know that we can get into this state even for unpleasant tasks as well - we can train that skill of doing Deep Work. 
* This kind of state is very helpful when you want to deliberately learn or practice something. You deeply think about a problem and load all the relevant data into your mind. Your brain can build the necessary neural connections. 
* I mentioned the term focused mode and diffuse mode on the last slide - deep work is your focused mode which will help your subconcious to have the necessary information for a problem to do the work for you. I.e. while you sleep
* The counterpart of deep work is shallow work. It is that work you do when you do fast context switching. Answering emails, being available on slack, meetings and so on. It is rather difficult to stay productive or creative while being shallow. But before everyone starts now to get read of all those distractions - according to the paper in the nineties - on average - we can only stay 4 hours in the deep work mode on a day. So there is plenty of time to do shallow work :) [^footnote]

## Methods

* So how do i support continuous learning and to utilize deep work in my daily life? With those five listed techniques i want to share with you now.
* These are the following:
	* Plan your time and Build routines
	* Drain the Shallows
	* Spaced Repetition
	* Measure yourself
	* Coding Katas

## How do i structure my daily life to provide that space for deliberate learning?

* i plan my months, weeks and days ahead - sometimes accurately, sometimes not so much
* but it helps me to clear my mind of the things i want to do - it helps to stay focused and to get rid of the feeling that you forgot something you really wanted to do 
* On a monthly scale i will layout broader topics i would like to follow - similar to or PGP / or the MDP on a venture level - obviously it is influenced by it as well - for example the last to months i focused a lot on task estimation and tech debt 
* on a weekly basis i try to create tasks based on different themes - networking for example or to learn something new from my peers (independet of the cohort) - getting feedback from team members or to research about the latest technology
* that is somethign i do on sundays - that's where i decide who i want to reach out to for having dinner or a coffee
* on a daily basis i try to lay out the next day at the end of my work day - even my free time - sure someone might think it sounds a lot of effort to plan your free time and that it might not benefit you. But just think about the last game you played or book you read while forgetting everything else around you. and now compare it with evenings where you had time but didn't not know what to do. What left you with a more pleasant feeling at the end of the day? If you prefer the first one, planning can help you with that. Even in your spare time.
* all this planning has a secondary goal - to create habits - it helps me to plan my day around certain routines to have an easy entry into deep work. For example before my evening session i currently try to meditate for 10 minutes to start with a clear mind. 
* At the end of each day i shut down my work day to get rid of the mental balast for the evening. I want to have the mental ressources to use my personal space for new learnings.

## Drain the Shallows

* how can you drain those shallows - how can you flee from the world of continuous distraction? 
* There are notable ways to do this:
1. Simply avoid those distractions while working deeply and deal with them later and by planning active shallow time - where it comes handy to actually plan your day
* everytime i work in a new team and we have a exercise where we explain individual expectations to work together - i emphasize - pls do not distract me when i work while wearing headphones
* in this situation i typically try to be in deep work and also reduce other distractions as well - by putting the apple devices in the do not disturb mode
2. the second way of draining your shallows is to actually drain them. 
* Make yourself rare - every one of us has the right to control its own communication - reset your correspondents expectation to the reality that you will probably not respond. I know, this is a kind of extreme measure but probably possible through good expectation management and an approbriate communication strategy. The author of the Book Deep work even recommends to not answer emails when one of the following three reasons applies: the content is ambiguous and makes it hard to generate a reasonable response. It is not a question or proposal that interests you. Or nothing really good or bad will happen if you do not reply. It is the senders responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile. Unfortunately i'm not doing this yet.
* But there is a second one concerning our communication and it is about how we actively shape our email / slack communication - Be specific in your messages so that you can steer the communication in a fashion that the number of follow up emails will reduce or ideally will be one.

## Spaced Repetition and Coding Katas

* In Germany we have this saying - Ãœbung macht den Meister - skill comes with practice - 
* to move new learnings from your short into your long term it is necessary to repeat your learnings. 
* This comes with two important findings:
	* do not solve the same problem over and over again with the same solution - either become creative in your solutions or switch to different kind of challenges in the same area - even increase the difficulty practicing the same solution over the same problem again and again leads to overlearning - a lot of people here should know the term overfitting from endless machine learning blogs and talks. This is kinda the same - you will be comfortable in solving that specific problem with that specific solution but it will be hard for you to transfer the concepts to other challenges
	* your repetition should be deliberate as well. That's why it is called spaced repetition - it means you will repeat something over and over again but with increasing periods in between.
* to apply this method i currently use to practices:
	* Spaced repetition in the form of digital flashcards and the so called Leitner System - in this system you will pick up a flashcard and answer it - if you answer is correct - the system will add a certain time - lets say 7 days to the waiting period until the card will show up next. It works similar the other way around with the difference that it will remove some time from the waiting period - so if you answer wrong it will show up again way more early
	* The second technique i'm currenlty using are Coding Katas - maybe some of you used them before. You pick a coding challenge and then solve it in certain ways. With this you can hone your functional or object oriented programming skills or you can improve certain paradigms. I currently try to use half an hour of my day in the morning to practice TDD by the book on simple challenges to be warmed up before diving into the production code.

## Measure yourself

* To get used to new habits - in this case the learning habit - it is important to measure your success. But i do not mean the completion of a specific learn goal - like finishing course A or B. It is not about measuring the goal but to document the tally of your learning habit - so measure the number of hours you invest in a week to practice new things deliberately. For example preparing a talk for this conference. 
* I started using a simple excel sheet to count the numbers of hours i invest in a week. Currently i'm using an app to be reminded of habits i want to incorporate into my day.

## Information Structuring / Memory

* Before i will summarize the topic i want to introduce some techniques you could use in your daily learning. One of the techniques i mentioned before is using flashcards to enforced spaced repition with your own created quizes. Creating your own quizzes helps to be creative and to directly connect the question with the answer in your head. You associate them with each other. 
* Another technique is the so called information structure - your progress looks like the following: you start with a simple mind map of your learnings - then create self administered quizzes to challenge yourself - this works well with flashcards - and in the last step you summarize your findings. The authoer of deep work is in to using expensive notebooks to record those findings - because they are expensive he tricks himself into high quality recordings.
* The last technique i want to introduce is the method of loci. The so called memory journey - (maybe start with the example of a memory journey - interactive part and then refer to that) - where you imagine a path in your mind - let it be a path through your room, house or your favorite running path - and then you construct a story around the stuff you want to remember / revisit. I'm currently on the Udacity Robotics and Deep Learning course and i try to construct a mind palace - in this case an ordinary house with empty rooms - to remember my learnings. Those rooms also help with retaining a specific order of your learnings.
