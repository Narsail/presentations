# Become a better engineer through Deep Work and continuous learning.


I have chosen that title because I believe that both, continuous learning and one of its core methods, Deep Work, made me a better engineer. I used the beginning of the year to read a couple of books about deliberate practice and how to learn - finally, after finishing university -  and i want to share with you how it changed my daily life.

## "The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled."

* imagine your their mind to be an empty cup - fill in as much as possible as fast as possible - your cup will eventually overflow
* that's how a lot of people actually learn - that's how i learned at the university from time to time and it has not been sustainable.
* but as you all know - just remember your time in school - it needs time and repetition to learn and sustain the vocabulary
* and you can only learn as much as a cup of tea every day - feed your fire every day a little and it will surprise yourself with sustainable knowledge.

Why is learning important?

* we are knowledge workers
	* the software world is a fast changing environment - our javascript developers can tell one or two things about it
	* we are moving into the area of business models and technologies that can distrupt domains - this happens in a fast pace
	* we are confronted with a whole bunch of challenges day to day
 * we form and train CTOs
 	* 	generalists need a broad understanding of different domains and technologies

## When should we learn?

* at  the last conference i attended - the software craftsmanship london - they discussed this topic without a conclusion on a panel
* the most pressing question was whether we should have time to learn at work and my personal opinion is that we should - and for apparent reasons it needs to happen on a regular basis and not only when we are on the beach - and i have a personal example i will come to later
* a part from having the opportunity at work - you should encourage yourself for lifelong learning - remember the last time you wondered how a specific framework functions - but you didn't follow that curiosity because of time constraints
* but this curiosity is what you lost at scale while growing up - kids are curious by default but need to learn stuff at school which might be useful but we are not curious about
* our skills are all too often shaped passively - your first job as a software engineer introduces you to Java - so now you are a Java developer - then someone comes into the team and applies agile methods - now you learned to be agile
* learning should not happen by accident but deliberate - deliberate learners are the most efficient ones
